# Komputer-Store - Milovan Glisovic
This application was made for educational purposes.

The application has three different functions: 
You have the ability to take loans which will increase your balance.


You have the ability to "work" which at every press will give you 100kr. Your pay can then be transfered to your bank balance or repay your active loan. Note that if you have an active loan and choose to transfer your pay to your bank directly, a 10% fee will be deducted to pay off your active loan.


You then have the ability to buy different computers, which will be drawn from your bank balance.
